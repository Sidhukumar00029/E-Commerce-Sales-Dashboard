# E-Commerce-Sales-Dashboard
This Power BI project provides an interactive and visually appealing dashboard to analyze e-commerce sales performance.
The dashboard tracks key metrics such as total sales amount, quantity sold, profit, and average order value (AOV). It gives insights into sales distribution across states, customer contributions, product categories, and payment modes.

The visualization includes:

Sales by State: Highlights top-performing regions like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

Category & Sub-Category Analysis: Breaks down sales and profit by product categories (Clothing, Electronics, Furniture) and sub-categories (Printers, Bookcases, Saree, etc.).

Profit Trends: Monthly profit trends showing seasonal highs and lows.

Customer Insights: Identifies high-value customers contributing most to revenue.

Payment Mode Analysis: Shows customer preferences for COD, UPI, Debit/Credit Cards, and EMI.

This dashboard enables business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, optimize sales strategies, and identify growth opportunities in different markets and product categories.
